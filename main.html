    <p>
      I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving real-world problems using technology. 
      Building applications that can help people, automate tasks, and make life easier motivates me to 
      learn and grow in this field. I love the creativity, logical thinking, and continuous learning that 
      come with software development.
